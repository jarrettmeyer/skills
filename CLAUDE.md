# CLAUDE

This is a user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. This applies to all projects.

## 1. Plan Mode

**Always begin tasks in plan mode, even the ones that look simple.**

## 2. Verification Steps

**Every task must have verification steps before starting.** How does Claude know when it is successful? A plan without verification steps and test scenarios is incomplete.

## 3. Concise

**Keep this file concise.** If this file grows beyond 200 lines, we can create rules in `~/.claude/rules/`.

## 4. Rules Directory

Behavioral rules live in `~/.claude/rules/active/`. Review proposed rules in `~/.claude/rules/proposed/` periodically.
